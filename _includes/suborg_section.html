                    Otters live on all continents except Australia and Antarctica. They can live on land and in the water.
                    Big otters and their bodies are long. They could be 2-6 feet. They have thick fur, and they have two layers of fur. Their thick fur helps them and keeps them out of the cold water. They have short ears and a small nose. It helps them make sure the water doesn't get into their noses and ears. They have a long tail and it helps them swim fast. Otters eat different foods. They eat animals that live in water like crabs, fish, oysters, and many other animals. Sometimes, they also eat animals that live on land like birds, rabbits, and more.

                    Most of the time the otters live alone, but in some seasons the otters live in small groups. Live otters are really intelligent and sociable. They play along with their voices and the sounds. They have a lot of sounds for different things. For example, if there are otters in a large group and a small otter needs to communicate with her mother, she can use a specific voice and a mother can hear that voice. The voices also help and notify other otters if there is danger.
                    Otters also communicate through body language. An otter mother can show her child whether she's angry or happy by the way she stands. Otters also communicate through smell. For example, they mark their territory with their feces and then other otters know that this is her place.
                    A male otter finds a female otter and before they mate, they play through movements. A female otter can give birth between 1-5 puppies at once, and then the mother raises and protects her cubs until she gives birth again, or after one year
